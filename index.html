                <p>
                What I want to be able to feel comfortable with whatever it is I end up doing as a full time job. I want to feel important to whatever company I end up working for. I want to be able to have fun working to help make working full time a little more enjoyable. I want to find a balance between work and socializing with others in order not to feel burnt out. I want others to describe me as a hard worker that gets the job done in a timely manner.
